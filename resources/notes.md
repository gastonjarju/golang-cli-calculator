Here's an updated plan tailored to include all the specified Go basics, mapped into the original structure of the plan:

### **Creating a CLI Calculator in Golang with Go Basics**

1. **Set Up Your Environment**  
   - [X] Install Golang on your system.  
   - [X] Create a new project directory and initialize a Go module (`go mod init`).  

2. **Plan the Calculator**  
   - Include basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
   - Extend functionality to include a history of calculations stored in a JSON file.  
   - Allow user interaction via CLI arguments and interactive input.  
   - Use a JSON file to save and retrieve calculation history.  

3. **Create the Main File**  
   - Define `main.go` as the program's entry point.  
   - Initialize the application by loading any previously stored data (e.g., from a JSON file).  
   - Provide options for users to either perform calculations or view history.  

4. **Input Handling**  
   - Use the `flag` package to parse operation type, operands, and options for viewing history.  
   - For interactive mode, use `bufio` to read user input.  
   - Validate input to ensure valid numbers, operators, and other required fields.  

5. **Implement Calculator Logic**  
   - Use **structs** to define calculations (e.g., `Operation` with fields like `Operand1`, `Operand2`, `Operator`, and `Result`).  
   - Define **receiver functions** for performing calculations on `Operation` structs.  
   - Implement **interfaces** for flexibility in supporting multiple types of operations.  

6. **Error Handling**  
   - Validate and gracefully handle invalid inputs (e.g., unknown operators, missing fields).  
   - Implement error handling for file operations (e.g., reading/writing the JSON file).  
   - Prevent division by zero by returning errors for invalid division attempts.  

7. **Format and Display Results**  
   - Use `fmt` for neat, user-friendly output.  
   - Maintain a **slice** of `Operation` structs to keep track of the history of calculations within a single session.  
   - Display results or history based on user input.  

8. **Data Persistence**  
   - Use a **map** to temporarily store calculations in memory during the session, keyed by a unique ID or timestamp.  
   - Save the history to a JSON file using `encoding/json`.  
   - Read from the JSON file on startup to load previously saved data into memory.  

9. **Testing**  
   - Write unit tests for each arithmetic function.  
   - Test file read/write functionality to ensure the JSON history is correctly stored and retrieved.  
   - Simulate a variety of CLI inputs for validation.  

10. **Build and Run**  
    - Compile the application with `go build`.  
    - Run the program with different CLI arguments or in interactive mode to ensure all features work correctly.  

11. **Iterate and Extend**  
    - Add support for advanced operations (e.g., power, square root, or trigonometry).  
    - Use **pointers** to modify shared data structures like the calculation history directly.  
    - Implement a loop to allow multiple calculations in a single session.  
    - Provide an option to clear history or reset the calculator.

Separating user prompts and operational logic into different functions or packages is an excellent idea for better modularity and maintainability. Here's how you can structure it:

### 1. **Use Separate Functions**
   - **Input Handling Function:** Create a function dedicated to handling user inputs (e.g., reading the operator and numbers). This keeps the main function cleaner.
   - **Operation Function:** Create a separate function to handle the logic for performing calculations based on the operator and inputs.

### 2. **Organize with Packages**
   - **Input Package:** Move the user input-related logic into a package (e.g., `input` package). The functions in this package can handle reading and validating inputs.
   - **Operation Package:** Move the arithmetic logic into a package (e.g., `operations` package). Each operation can be implemented as a separate function within this package.

### 3. **Interfaces for Extensibility**
   - Define an interface for operations if you want to add more complex or custom operations in the future. For example, an `Operation` interface with a method like `Execute()` could be implemented by different structs representing operations.

### 4. **Utility Functions**
   - Use utility functions for tasks like validating inputs, converting strings to numbers, or formatting results. These can be grouped in a package like `utils` if widely reused.

### 5. **Error Handling**
   - Return errors from the input and operation functions or packages to handle issues (e.g., invalid operator, divide by zero) gracefully in the main program.

### 6. **Encapsulate State**
   - Use structs to encapsulate the state of the calculator (e.g., operator, operands, result). Implement receiver methods on the struct to perform calculations or display results.

### 7. **Modular File Structure**
   Example structure:  
   ```
   calculator/
   ├── main.go        // Main entry point
   ├── input/         // Input handling
   │   └── input.go
   ├── operations/    // Arithmetic logic
   │   └── operations.go
   ├── utils/         // Reusable utilities
   │   └── utils.go
   ```

### 8. **Configuration Options**
   - If you want to make the calculator configurable (e.g., add new operations dynamically), you can use JSON or other configuration files loaded at runtime.

This approach promotes modular design, reusability, and testability while keeping each component focused on a single responsibility.
