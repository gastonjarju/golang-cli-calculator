### Day 1-2: Improve Code Structure and Error Handling
- Concepts Covered: Structs, functions, error handling.
    - [X] Add error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values for numbers, invalid operations).
    - [] Use functions for checking the validity of user inputs (e.g., check if the operator is valid).
    - [] Review and refactor the PerformCalculation function to handle division by zero and other edge cases.
