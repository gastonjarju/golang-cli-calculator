### Project Roadmap and Suggestions for Improving the CLI Calculator

Here’s a roadmap for your Go CLI Calculator project, with a focus on enhancing both the functionality and learning experience as you progress from beginner to intermediate concepts. The plan includes tasks for daily progress, along with suggestions on Go concepts to apply and experiment with.

---

### **Week 1: Foundations and Initial Enhancements**

**Goal:** Complete the basic functionality and improve basic Go concepts (such as structs, functions, error handling, and input validation).

#### **Day 1-2: Improve Code Structure and Error Handling**
- **Concepts Covered**: Structs, functions, error handling.
  - Add **error handling** for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values for numbers, invalid operations).
  - Use **functions** for checking the validity of user inputs (e.g., check if the operator is valid).
  - Review and refactor the `PerformCalculation` function to handle division by zero and other edge cases.

#### **Day 3-4: Structs and Validation**
- **Concepts Covered**: Structs, methods, validation.
  - Create methods for validating the `CalculationInput` struct.
  - Refactor input handling: implement separate functions for validating numbers and operators.
  - Make use of Go's **error handling** pattern by returning errors when invalid input is detected.

#### **Day 5-6: Implementing Logging and More Robust Errors**
- **Concepts Covered**: Logging, error handling, file operations.
  - Implement **logging** of the calculation results to a log file (`logs.txt`), and include error messages if something goes wrong.
  - Expand on error handling by wrapping errors with additional context using `fmt.Errorf()`.

#### **Day 7: Testing**
- **Concepts Covered**: Unit testing, Go testing framework.
  - Write basic **unit tests** for the `PerformCalculation` function, testing for valid and invalid operations.
  - Use Go’s built-in testing framework to write simple test cases that check for edge cases like dividing by zero or invalid operations.

### **Week 2: Intermediate Concepts and Enhancements**

**Goal:** Enhance the calculator's features by implementing additional operations and introducing more advanced concepts such as receiver functions, Go modules, and working with external files.

#### **Day 8-9: Add More Operations and Refactor Code**
- **Concepts Covered**: Receiver functions, function overloading (or method sets), refactoring.
  - Refactor `PerformCalculation` by creating separate functions for each operation (e.g., `Add`, `Subtract`, `Multiply`, `Divide`).
  - Implement the **receiver functions** for performing these operations as methods on the `CalculationInput` struct.
  
#### **Day 10-11: Go Modules and Packages**
- **Concepts Covered**: Go modules, organizing code into packages.
  - Convert your project into a **Go module** by running `go mod init` and managing dependencies properly.
  - Refactor the project by creating separate packages for input, operations, and validation. This helps organize your code and make it modular.
  - Structure the directories for each package (`input/`, `operations/`, etc.) and organize code to follow Go’s conventions.

#### **Day 12-13: Implementing User Interface Enhancements**
- **Concepts Covered**: Working with files, user interaction, loops.
  - Enhance the **CLI interface** to allow users to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program. Implement a loop for continuous input.
  - Store previous operations and results in a text file (`history.txt`) and display them when prompted.
  - Use Go’s `os` and `io` libraries for reading from and writing to files.

#### **Day 14: Testing and Refining Error Handling**
- **Concepts Covered**: Unit testing, error handling, Go modules.
  - Refactor and write additional **unit tests** to handle edge cases.
  - Add more robust error handling, such as capturing input errors and invalid operation errors.

### **Week 3: Advanced Concepts and Project Expansion**

**Goal:** Integrate more advanced Go concepts such as concurrency, advanced testing, and modularizing the code further for reusability.

#### **Day 15-16: Concurrency (Goroutines)**
- **Concepts Covered**: Goroutines, channels.
  - Introduce **concurrency** to allow the calculator to handle multiple calculations at once.
  - Use **goroutines** to calculate results concurrently, especially if you plan to add a feature to handle multiple users or multiple operations in parallel.

#### **Day 17-18: Structuring the Codebase and Enhancements**
- **Concepts Covered**: Dependency Injection, interfaces.
  - Enhance modularity by introducing interfaces for different operations (e.g., `CalculatorOperation` interface) to decouple the calculation logic from the input and validation layers.
  - Use **dependency injection** to pass in the correct calculator method based on the user's operation.

#### **Day 19-20: Enhanced Testing (Mocking, Integration Tests)**
- **Concepts Covered**: Mocking, integration testing.
  - Write **integration tests** to test the interaction between different packages (input validation, operations, and user interface).
  - Use **mocking** to simulate user inputs and external interactions in your tests.

#### **Day 21: Refactoring and Final Polishing**
- **Concepts Covered**: Code refactoring, documentation.
  - Refactor your code to make it cleaner and more efficient.
  - Add **documentation** for each package and function, explaining their purposes and usage.
  - Polish the user interface (e.g., improve prompts and error messages).

### **Week 4: Final Touches and Deployment**

**Goal:** Finalize the project, ensure it’s robust, well-tested, and prepare for deployment.

#### **Day 22-23: Packaging and Deployment**
- **Concepts Covered**: Building Go applications, deployment.
  - Learn how to **build and deploy** your Go program as a binary executable (`go build`).
  - Package your application for distribution, and add a README file for instructions on how to install and use the CLI calculator.

#### **Day 24-26: Review and Clean-Up**
- **Concepts Covered**: Code review, clean-up.
  - Review your codebase and remove unnecessary comments or unused code.
  - Ensure your code follows Go conventions (e.g., naming conventions, readability).

#### **Day 27-28: Final Testing and User Feedback**
- **Concepts Covered**: User feedback, final bug fixes.
  - Test the final version of your CLI calculator thoroughly.
  - Ask a friend or peer to use the calculator and provide feedback.
  - Fix any bugs or issues that arise.

#### **Day 29-30: Project Summary and Reflection**
- **Concepts Covered**: Reflection, continuous learning.
  - Summarize your project and note what you’ve learned along the way.
  - Reflect on the concepts you found most difficult and plan for continued learning in Go.

### **Project Ideas for the Future:**
- **Advanced Calculation Features**: Implement more complex operations, such as trigonometric functions or matrix operations.
- **Web Interface**: Convert your CLI calculator into a web application using Go and frameworks like `net/http`.
- **Graphical Interface**: Build a graphical interface using a package like `gotk3` or `Fyne`.
- **Integration with APIs**: Extend your calculator to fetch data from external APIs (e.g., financial data or weather data) for more context in your calculations.
- **Persistent Storage**: Use a database to store historical calculations and retrieve them for later.

---

### **Conclusion:**

By following this roadmap, you will not only improve the functionality of your calculator but also gain a deeper understanding of Go’s fundamental concepts. The project will help you apply practical Go skills while keeping your learning structured and progressive. 

Spend at least **30 minutes daily**, as you requested, and by the end of this month, you will have a well-developed CLI calculator and a solid foundation in Go!
